# l0_spca
This repository contains numerical experiments implementing sparse pca using l0-norm as penalty. In the experiments, it is shown that when the data set has more variables than observations, the algorithm does not converge. However, this is circumvented by perturbing either the original set of data or it sample covariance matrix. 

File op_spca.py contains the necessary functions and in Note_l0.pynb can be used as a guide of how to used them.
